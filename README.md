# SubFix

**A simple, free tool to auto-format subtitles to meet strict distributor specs.**

Created by an indie filmmaker tired of doing subtitle adjustments by hand, this app automatically corrects subtitle timing and formatting issuesâ€”perfect for delivery to platforms like FilmHub or BitMax.

## ðŸ›  Install

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
./install.sh

## Features

- Adjust subtitle start/end times to match required timing ranges
- Fix formatting issues, such as too many lines per event
- Perform basic spellchecking
- Output compliant `.srt` files ready for distribution

## Why This Exists

As a self-distributing filmmaker, I handle every part of the processâ€”including delivery. Formatting subtitles to match platform specs was a tedious task I had to repeat for every release. I built this app to automate that step and reclaim some sanity.

I'm a novice coder, so the project is simple for nowâ€”but it's open-source and evolving.

**Contributions and feedback are very welcome!**

## Download & Use

**[Download the latest version here](link to GitHub Releases or DMG file pending...)**

Just drag and drop your `.srt` file into the app and it will:

- Fix overlapping subtitles
- Normalize duration lengths
- Apply formatting fixes
- Output a cleaned `.srt` file ready for upload

> Mac only for now. (Windows/Linux users: want to help port it?)
